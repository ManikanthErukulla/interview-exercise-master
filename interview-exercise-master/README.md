The tests are written using TESTNG TDD framework style. 

How to run?
1. Download the repo
2. Download the plug-ins using POM - this should now save the TESTNG jars as well
3. Right click on the testng.xml file and Run as TESTNG. 

Results should appear on the console. 

Please note that I have used DataProvider facility in TESTNG where I have provided all the different combinations of data to be passed on to the isValid function.
